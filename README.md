# Starbucks Challenge

This exercise was a proxy for a real world geospatial analysis problem.  Given a set a addresses for Starbucks coffee shops, found at https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=1D4kfAMzX3FME8MkR9rVhd9rJ9gKEP00XZqiyQCc#rows:id=1, and several cities, the task was to determine which locations are within certain distances from the city center.

This code also shows different ways to map the data, related to both the original task and more generically.
